### A gentle intro to GitHub

### Why GitHub?

```{r out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/final.gif")
```


---

### Why GitHub?

Version control! 

* One document with multiple versions inside it

* Roll back to a previous version if you need to

* Each version has a commit message that (should!) explain what has changed


<div class="bottom-right-logo"></div>
---

### Why GitHub?

Collaboration!

* ...even if it's just with your future self

* Gives you a shared workspace that keeps track of who has made what changes and when

* Multiple branches enable safe development and (sort of) simultaneous working

### What is Git? What is GitHub?

.pull-left[
*Git* is version control software

* install on your computer 
* allows you to create a local repo(sitory) that you commit your files to
* keeps track of changes, allows you to roll back
* can push local repositories to remote ones to allow collaboration
]

.pull-right[
*GitHub* hosts Git repos online
* a backup if nothing else
* others can see/contribute
* log and resolve issues
* organise your project
]

<div class="bottom-right-logo"></div>

---

### Using GitHub without installing Git

* A way to browse a project's files

* Drag and drop to add - it makes a commit

* You can edit *some* files

* You can go back in time and see/download work from a previous version of the repo

<div class="bottom-right-logo"></div>

---

### Why bother installing Git?

* It tells you what has changed

* Easy workflow (eventually!) - diff, add, commit, push

* Allows your machine to talk directly to GitHub

<div class="bottom-right-logo"></div>

---

### The Git/GitHub workflow

![git-diagram](img/git-diagram.gif)

---

### The Git/GitHub workflow

* create/edit files in local working directory

* **add** files to the *staging area* 

* **commit** these staged files to your local *Git repository*

* **push** what you just committed to your *remote* repository on GitHub


<div class="bottom-right-logo"></div>

### Setup

1) Get a GitHub account

2) Install Git for Windows

3) Introduce yourself (with the same email address as your GitHub account)

In Git Bash (should have installed with Git for Windows):

```{r engine = 'bash', eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
git config --global user.name 'Jane Doe'
git config --global user.email 'jane@example.com'
```

you can check that's worked with

```{r, engine = 'bash', eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
git config --global --list
```

(output should show your user name and email)

---

### New project with GitHub from the start

Really straightforward with RStudio:

1) Create a repo on GitHub, copy the URL

2) In RStudio: new project > version control > paste in the URL from GitHub

3) All set up! The Git box in the top right hand corner lets you stage, commit and push

This is probably the simplest way to add an existing project to GitHub as well

---

### Using the command line to put a project on GitHub

1) Open Git bash 

2) Navigate to your project folder

3) Turn the folder into a git repository: 

```{r, engine = 'bash', eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
git init
```

4) Add and commit your files:

```{r, engine = 'bash', eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
```

Now you have a local repo...

---

### Use the command line???

5) Create a blank GitHub repo, copy the URL

6) Connect your local and remote repos:

```{r, engine = 'bash', eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
git remote add origin https://github.com/helen-food/test-project.git
```

7) Push from local to remote

```{r, engine = 'bash', eval = FALSE, echo=TRUE}
git push -u origin master
```

### That's Git in a nutshell

### Great resources

GitHub's own [Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/) has online training courses 
starting from the very basics

Jenny Bryan's [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) takes you 
through getting R/RStudio to talk to Git/GitHub step by step

Karl Broman's minimal primer 
[git/github guide: a minimal tutorial](https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/) covers 
all the main functionality although it is all command line based
